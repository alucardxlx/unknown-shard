Important: Never use the kill command on Talon3 or 4 you will end up with missing animation and Talon 4 or 5 will be invisable which will pose a big problem!  

	Start off by putting all Quest Mobiles out.  Talon should be put where there are no guards to worry about becuase shortly into the quest he turns red and tries to kill the player doing the quest.  He will attack anyone within range though.  I felt if I set him to only kill the player in the quest they could easily bring someone who wasn't in the quest and have them slay him with no recourse.  Do not forget Talon needs to be set on a spawner so if he is killed he will respawn.  I'd set his Home range at around 8 tiles.  Also he opens a gate when killed to go get Merlins Staff.  All gates in this quest open automatically and decay in roughly 30-45 seconds.  Next Set out Merlin. He needs to be spawned in Wind park,  around him you will add DeathTile's comlpetely around and under him then in a square or however around the tiles add MelinsField. Then spawn Merlin2 in Nu'Jeleom  the best way to tell where to spawn him is add MerlinsGate2 step through and spawn him in the middle between both sets of stairs.  *Peraniese Should be Spawned in Trinsic Somewhere*

	With them spawned you should Spawn the monsters to this quest; KeyHolder, MordridsMinion, Mordrid, TheGuardian, TheGargoyle, and Talon3. 

	The KeyHolder should be placed in wind park along with MordridsMinion and Merlin.  Next spawn Mordrid in the 3rd level of Wrong.  TheGuardian should be spawned at the pyramid in Malas.  Then TheGargoyle should be spawned on Marble Island.  Talon3 should be spawned somewhere within Ankh Dungeon.

Next in the bottom of Wisp dungeon [add Merlingsgate and go through it in there you'll notice all kinds of tele pads and pylons that block movement.  Delete some of the telepads and  some of the pylons and add ISTile's 1-4 and Deathtiles through-out that area. Through the door to the West you'll see and area of grey ties with a brown one in the middle add a block and spawn MerlinsStaff on top of that becuase it will be taken by all who do the quest.

	Markers are placed on player to judge how far in the quest they are and to allow the Mobiles to know how to respond to them.  Without the markers the Quest items are imposible to gain making it neccessary for a player to do the full Quest.  Markers are invisable and auto delete after seven days if your player hasn't finished the Quest in 7 days they need to start over.  P.S. a side note please give me feed back on what you thought of the Quest I know it's easy to just take the Quest and install it and enjoy but every scripter works some serious time to create something like this for "your players". Most scripters like myself don't have the time to play and enjoy the Quest/Scripted material.  So we rely on positive feedback from those who chose to use our scripts.  Thanks and enjoy.
