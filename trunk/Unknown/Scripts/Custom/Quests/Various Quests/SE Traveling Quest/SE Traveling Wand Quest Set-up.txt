SE Traveling Wand Quest.
Created by Skarth.

This takes a little bit of time to set up, because you have to go to all the places and set up
	spawners for the runes.  But it shouldn't take too long once you get the hang of it.

All runes are named GR#, where # is the number of the spawn.  I made it short so that when you
	set up the spawners, you won't have to type out things like "britbanktrammelrune". You
	simply have to type GR# (the # that corresponds to the respective point).

To begin, I would recommend that you give yourself an SE traveling wand. It will make this set
	up a LOT easier.  Just type:  [add SETravelingWand
	Then place it on the ground and pick it up.

The basic way of doing this (and the easiest) is to use your traveling wand to go to the
	various spots to add the spawners. Below you will see the spot, as well as the GR# to
	add on a spawner. The numbers are in the same order as your traveling wand for easier
	use.

NOTE: Papua spawners needs to be set up to have a spawn range of ZERO! If you set the spawn range
	to be anything except 0, then it's very likely that the rune will spawn under the bank.
	So make sure you set those 2 spawners (1 in Trammel, 1 in Felucca) to have a zero spawn
	range.

Here's the list. Simply use your wand to go to the spot, and add a spawner somewhere around that
	area. Might be best to print this off for you to use when setting this up.
