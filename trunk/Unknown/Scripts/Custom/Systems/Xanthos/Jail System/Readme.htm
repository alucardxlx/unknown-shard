	<h3>Jail System 2.0 by Xanthos</h3>
	<p>This is a basic jailing and speech monitor system. If a player says any of the words in the file jaiwords.cs, they will be automatically jailed on the spot. If you want the system to monitor chat speech as well there is a method, in jailcommand.cs, that must be called from the chat command handler. An example and explanation for how to do this with Knives Chat 2.0 is provided in jailcommand.cs. If you want to prevent players from leaving jail using the stuck option you will also need to set up a custom region encompassing your jail; Regions In a Box works well for that.</p>
	<p>Also provided with this package is a modified copy of a single distro file to make the luck calculation work to boost the intensities of generated loot in a similar fashion to EA shards. This file also brings the quality of runic crafted items on par with EA shards. Use of this modified BaseRunicTool.cs file is optional - if you choose not to use it, simply remove it. Otherwise, if you choose to use this file, remove the distro file with the same name.</p>
