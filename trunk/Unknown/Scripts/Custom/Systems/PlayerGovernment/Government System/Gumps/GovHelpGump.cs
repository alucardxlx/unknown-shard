Now we need to find a good spot for your city. When picking your spot be sure and find a nice open area so others can place there homes near by so your city will grow. Also it will have to be at least {1} yards (Tiles) away from any other city or guarded area. Be sure you like the spot your at because once you have placed the hall you cannot reclaim its deed.<BR>Well, now that we have your city hall placed. Now we need citizens. You will have to get {2} citizens within 24 hours or your city will be deleted. Since you can have all of your characters from your account join the city. You can find a few of your close friends and have them join the city with all their characters and you should be fine. You will also want to add funds to your city treasury, Each time your city updates your city gets charged a maintenance fee, If you city lacks the funds your city deletes.

Like in real life, Taxes go to improve the town (We hope) same goes for taxes on here. Alot of money will go into a city. You have maintenance charges, Civic buildings cost money or resources. and the more your city grows the more it will end up costing you and if the monies not in the treasury, Poof no more city. So as soon as your city is at the level to levy taxes it is a very good idea to start them off small, Of course your citizens will not want to pay taxes but it will be your job as mayor to make them understand where that money is going it will also be your job as mayor to spend the money wisely... or on that new katana you have been looking for. As mayor you can withdraw all the money from the treasury as you wish. Just be careful because when you do all online citizens are notified that you did. And if they are concerned 
			citizens they will want to know where their hard earned tax money is going.<BR>When tax time comes around (During City Update) the money will be withdrawn from you and your citizen's bank accounts. That's right even the mayor pays. If, for some reason the citizen lacks the gold in their bank at that time. There will be a check every time that player logs in and will take what money they have towards their back taxes or if they have the full amount it will take all the back taxes owned to the city. The player will not have a choice in this matter. That is part of being in the city.<BR>Charging too much for taxes can make your citizens not want to live in your city but you, as mayor can levy taxes from 0 = no taxes to 10000 in taxes each week, There are 3 types of taxes: Income, Property, and Travel. Property gets withdrawn from the citizen's bank account each week, and income from their City Player Vendors, however Travel will only get charged when someone uses a civic moongate, coming or going from your city. This way you can charge non-members of the
			city a fee to use your public moongates. and if they use a public moongate outside of your city to come to your city they get charged as well.<BR>Charging to little on taxes will end up making you pay out of your pocket alot of money in maintenance, and even losing your city.

Players can deposit gold into the treasury any time they wish. The mayor can also deposit and withdraw from it at any time. The money stored in the treasury is used mainly for the city maintenance. Also the mayor can choose to use it for anything he/she wishes. Again this is totally up to the mayor. Whether they use it for city needs or personal needs. Lack of money in the treasury will result in the city being deleted. Each week, when the maintenance is tallied up the city withdraws what it needs to stay running. If it doesn't have enough, the city will be deleted and all the civic structures with it. All locked down items (Other than in player homes) will be released for anyone to grab and the mayor will not be able to reclaim their deeds for civic buildings.<BR>It is a very good idea to keep a close eye on the treasury and the

You will also get more city lock downs and your cities limits will expand. Your city can get up to 250x250 from the city halls location. thats a pretty big open area for cities. Each level comes with its own rank for the city. So, say you have a lot of citizens when people enter your city. They could get a message like  'You have entered the empire of Arwen's city'. But in order to get there you must get people to move to your city. Just because a player owns a house within city limits, that does not make them a citizen. They have to join the city stone. If not, they are just wasted space in your city. They are living in your city and not paying taxes. And you cant ban anyone who owns a house in the city. So
			its always a good idea to keep your cities housing turned off so only when you enable can new people place houses within your city.<BR>As your city grows you can enable new features like hiring guards, and registering your city. When you register your city it will show up on public moongate city list (That is if your city has a moongate) and players can come to your city and view your city's vendors and features.

Your going to want to have a moongate and charge a travel tax. This will bring more money into your city. If you have vendors that are popular and well stocked, you will want a moongate
			as well. If your near a dungeon you might want to add a healer. So players come to your city to be resurrected. You can charge a fee to resurrect at a city and that money goes right back into the city treasury. If your near a site where people die alot this could bring in alot of extra cash flow. All these extra building will cost your more in maintenance but if placed correctly can bring in far more money each week than they take out.
