in the modified folders are scripts that should either replace your distro files or if yours are modified they should be merged with your files.

\scripts\spells\base\spellregistry.cs
\scripts\spells\base\initializer.cs
\scripts\spells\base\reagent.cs
\scripts\items\skill items\magical\spellbook.cs


all other files should be placed in to your \scripts\custom directory

then simply restart your shard and enjoy
