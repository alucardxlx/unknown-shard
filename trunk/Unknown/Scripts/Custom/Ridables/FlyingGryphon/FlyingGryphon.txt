
Flying Gryphon, all compiles and no bugs found as yet.  Please let me know if you find any; but know I am still learning to script.

My first submission to the community, Credit goes to the one who made the flying pet script, which I do not know your name, my apologies. 
And to Admin Vile for the Flying Chimera Script which inspired me. I modified this for RUNUO 2.0 SVN 156.

This is  NOT my script, I take no credit other than I modified it to work with RUNUO 2, and gave it a new name for my shard.  
This is a modified script of the Flying Chimera script by Admin Vile.

I hope you enjoy it.

Things I am working on: I am still trying to perfect the flying, to make look smoother in flight.

Instruction for Modifying your player mobile 



In PlayerMobile.cs  around 74  find

public class PlayerMobile : Mobile, IHonorTarget
	{

and just after this line add:

////////// Edit for Gryphon//////////
public Timer m_Flyingtimer; //for Gryphon
///////////End Edit/////////////


Then around line 1082 find this line :

public override bool Move( Direction d )
		{


and just under it add the following:

//////////////////////////Edit for Hippogryp////////////////////////////
if (Mount is Gryphon)
			{
				if ( m_Flyingtimer != null )
				{
					m_Flyingtimer.Stop();
					m_Flyingtimer = null;
					CloseGump( typeof( Gryphongump ) );
					SendGump(new Gryphongump( this, 0 ) ); 
				}

			}
////////////////////////End edit for Gryphon/////////////////////////


and around line 1493 look for this line:

public override void OnDoubleClick( Mobile from )
		{
			if ( this == from && !Warmode )
			{
				IMount mount = Mount;

just after Mount; add the following:

///////////////////edit for Gryphon/////////////////////////////////////////
if ( mount is Gryphon )
					from.CloseGump( typeof( Gryphongump ) );

////////////////////end edit for Gryphon/////////////////////////////////////////////

Drop the Gryphon files into your custom folder and your good to go.  Credit goes to Admin Vile for his Flying chimera Script.
