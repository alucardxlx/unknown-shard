1. Removed random encounter system since I found an easier way to impliment it without using as many resources.
2. Added special book covers to dye bulk order deed books different colors.
3. Working on advanced currency and reward system like the good ole darky can.
4. Tweaked the skill and stat gains to be more server compatible.
