1. Reduced the weight of ore so that players can carry more.
2. Added maxitems/maxweight to players backpack to be more based on stats vs original UO.
3. Tweaked some of the Settings for player advancement.  Very minor.
4. Fixed some bugs if not all of the bugs with the samurai beginner quest thanks to the help of Vox.
5. New server is fine tuned and quite operational.  I would say it is around a 174% increase in performance.  also went from 500max online host to 1000max online host. So I can support that many players at once.
