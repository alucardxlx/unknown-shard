1. Started scripting the first portion of the Orcish Quest.
2. Started working on the itemid bugs with crafted and store bought items.
3. Still trying to fine tune the stat gain.  Since I have not seen any dex or int gains.
4. Any quests that you have completed and recieved everything please report on the forums so that I know that the quest is 100% working.
