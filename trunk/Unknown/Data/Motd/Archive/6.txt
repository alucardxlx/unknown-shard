1. Tested the afkchecker on myself. All the player has to do is enter in the letter/number combination and it doesn't change.  Once you do it your fine.
2. Finished writing the storyline of the next big chain quest.  Over 8 pages of story in a book I wrote.
3. Edited the gains for Dex and Int.  They should be more noticable.  It seems like players have been mainly gaining str.
4. Added new ItemID system that makes everything that you loot unidentified.  Adds to the RP effect and gives use to ItemID.
5. Added around 25 more npcs with necro abilities for future quests.  They are not spawned yet.
6. Added and tested out a necro stone to get reagents from. They Will be around the world.
7. Added a bunch of housing addons that are going to be event related.
8. Working on and testing out a Necro Vendor.
9. Tested our the BlackLich which will also be used on later quests.
10. Making a purpose of bola balls. :)
