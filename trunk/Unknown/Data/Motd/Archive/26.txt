1. Added a instance dungeon for new players to try out somewhere near haven. It is a multipart quest testing out a lot of new quest ideas.
2. Character files had to be wiped due to massive changes to the server.
3. I would recommend using UOpatch.exe to get your client version to at least 5.0.6b It allows you to see the new mounts.
