1. Added some easier utilization on treasuremaps also some core mods to allow me to edit them better by using xml.
2. Tweaked so I can actually specify which spells monsters can use and when.
3. Did another xml add that allows certain npcs have a commanding npc.  Also allows following of multiple npcs.
4. Fixed britain quest #9 issue with spawning.
