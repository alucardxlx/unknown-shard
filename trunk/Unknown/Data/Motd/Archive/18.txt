1. Updated login and logout system that shows when players/staff login.
2. Updated some of the console commands to allow me better interaction with players while not being actually ingame.
3. Added a nice little command that allows staff to initiate an event and have players respond to the event time to actually get automatically teleported to the event in progress.
4. Updated the pet follow speeds to be less likely to loose them when you are running around at full speed.
5. Added 3 beginning quests for Delucia.  Also redid the scripting for the previous 3 section quests I made to be more user friendly.
